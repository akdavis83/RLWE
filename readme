# Key Points
RLWE-Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) is a popular post-quantum cryptography scheme that uses a ring learning with errors (RLWE) model to generate public and private keys. The scheme is based on the assumption that the underlying ring is a polynomial ring over a finite field, and the public key is a polynomial of degree n-1, where n is a power of 2. The private key is a polynomial of degree n, and the scheme is secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks.

This Javascript version is a preliminary version of the original Go implementation found here: https://github.com/TSignalproject/rlwe/blob/master/rlwe.go

FFT Implementation:

The FFT functions (fftForward and fftBackward) implement the twisted FFT.

Modular Arithmetic:

All operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) are performed modulo q.

Key Pair Generation:

A private key is a random polynomial.
The public key is the FFT-transformed version of the private key.
Key Encapsulation:

A random polynomial is used to generate the ciphertext and shared secret.

Key Decapsulation:

The receiver uses their private key to recover the shared secret from the ciphertext.

# Next Steps
Parameter Validation:

Ensure the parameters (n, q, etc.) meet security requirements for RLWE.

Optimization:

Use efficient libraries like big-integer for handling large integers if needed.
Testing:

Verify correctness with test vectors or by comparing with the original Go implementation.
Security:

Implement constant-time operations to prevent timing attacks.
